<p>Hi Alice,<br>For some reason our malware scanning program has broken and our main software develper is on holiday. Our number one client needs to have their binaries checked for malware ASAP! Can you please manually check if any of our clients binaries are infected? I have attached our list of malware signatures as well as a compressed directory containing all our clients binaries.<br>Paul</p>
