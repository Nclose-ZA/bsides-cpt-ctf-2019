<h2>Classification</h2>
<p class="classified">Top Secret</p>
<h2>Date</h2>
<p>November 12, 1977</p>
<h2>Briefing</h2>
<p>Attention Researchers</p>
<p>It has recently been confirmed that the Russian submarine known as 'The Vladimir' is in fact carrying nuclear weapons. Our Cyber Security Unit has been able to intercept a encrypted message sent to submarine commander Colonel Ourumov. It is of high importance that we decipher this message a soon as possible as we believe it to be a pin code to engage the submarines plutonium cores. It is confirmed that the RSA system has been used to perform the encryption. You will need to derive Colonel Ourumov's private key in order to decrypt the ciphertext. Good luck, the future of this nation depends on you! [military drum line]</p>
