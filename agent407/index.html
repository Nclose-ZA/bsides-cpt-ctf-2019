<p>Welcome back agent407. Your line manager has recomended you to participate in operation blackwater due to your strenghts in mobile security. Your objective is to recover a Unique API token belonging to Uma Bowden, a member of radical group named 'The Gunners'. Your colleagues were able to recover an android application specifically designed for Uma to receive information from the Gunners control servers. The application is not fully developed and still considered unstable, however we have reason to believe that Uma's unique token can still somehow be recovered.<p>
<p>The applicatin would allow Uma get infomation on locations she is supposed to be attacking via an API request. The app lets Uma send API requests to different Servers that the gunners control - we suppose this is because they are suffering from our ddos attacks and airstrikes from other factions.</p>
<p>Our infosec team has reason to belive Uma's Unique token can be recovered by sniffing all outbound connections that application is making. Our new intern suggested decompiling the application as an additional attack vector. A link to the application can be found below. We are counting on you. Good Luck.</p>

<p>PS: If you are doing that funny bsides challenge thing, you can use use Uma's unique token as the flag for the agent407 box<p>
